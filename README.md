# Domain-Age-Checker

Domain Age Checker module is for Joomla 3.x and Joomla 4.x version.

Using this tool, you may determine an exact domain's or website's age from the time it was registered to the present. One of the key elements that search engines take into account when determining a website's position is the domain age. Our tool will assist you in finding various TLDs (.com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .us, .uk, .ca, .tel, .ie, .it, .cc, .ws, .sc, .mobi, .pro, .edu, .tv, .travel, .in, .me, .cn, .asia, .ro, .aero and .nu), and we will soon add more
